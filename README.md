## My process

- I broke down the project into smaller tasks, I first started by breaking the project down into individual pages and then into smaller subsections. By taking this approach it made it easier to develop and also helped with not getting stuck.

- Once the html was written, I started with styling, keeping a mobile first approach in mind, and then implementing media queries for desktop viewing.

- React context was used for keeping track of the theme state. Altough using context was overkill, it was a good refresher. I could have just lifted the state as the project is small in size with few components.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

On top of keeping my react skills sharp, some additional things I've learnt while developing this project was how to change the theme of a website alongside with imgs by using context in React. Trying to learn TypeScript is a bit fustrating but by forcing myself to step out of my comfort zone and developing this project using it was a step in the right direction. Becoming more familiar with Sass and it's features was also a plus.

### Continued development

Increasing my proficiency and knowledge with TypeScript as this was probably my second every project developing with it. It is still very new to me and I can now see why it is soo popular, it can prevent silly bugs in the code by providing type checking and other features and has saved me a few moments whilst developing this challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This is a wonderful ai tool which I use from time to time when wanting to know what css properties to use if im stuck or how to achieve a certain style. It also helps with my coding and acts as a sort of mentor which greatly improves my skills.
